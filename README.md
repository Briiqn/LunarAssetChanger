# LunarAssetChanger
Change the assets of lunar client after the update (linux &amp; mac only atm)

How does it work?

it extracts the Java archive entitled lunar-assets-prod-3-optifine.jar which only contains the assets, not code, of lunar client which then is put into a folder located in ~/Lunar-Assets/(The version you extracted)

from there you can modify the assets of lunar client and run build.sh to reput the assets into a Java Archive.
